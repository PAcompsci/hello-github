# Welcome to GitHub Classroom
## Phillips Academy CSC630: Data Structures and Algorithms, Spring 2017

This is the first assignment for CSC630, Spring 2017.  In this class, we'll be trying out GitHub Classroom, an automated assignment-generation tool built on top of GitHub.  This allows us to get practice with git and GitHub while completing the assignments for the course.

1. For this first assignment, I want you to go through the online tool for learning git:

 [Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

 As you work through this, **create and submit** a reference document (text file) that gives a very short description of the functionality of each of the commands you used.

2. One thing that I recommend you also look through is an online resource on Markdown, a lightweight markup syntax.  This text file is a `.md` file, meaning it can be rendered (for example, on GitHub) in an attractive way, and code-sensitive editors like Atom can give you syntax highlighting for it.  Check out and bookmark some website to make simple markdown, for example:

 [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

 You can use it whenever you make a homework submission.
